# Innocent-bot

A Discord client self-bot for destroying, nuking and causing mischief in servers. 💣

## Why?

As of recent, I've seen multiple Discord communities I have been a part of been pathetically raided or messed with. With **Innocent**, I plan to change that. No more will a server go partially destroyed. No more will it take days to rename everyone for a joke. **__I do not encourage raiding but if you're going to do a job, at least do it right.__** Also, I saw Kyle2000 was charging a stupid amount of money for a little bit of buggy JS, so I decided to make my own edition that's free. Eventually, it will contain more features such as deleting all channels, renaming the server constantly, and many more.

## Commands

* `kall` - short for kick all, kicks every member in the server as long as you have permission.
* `ball` - short for ban all, bans every member in the server as long as you have permission.
* `rall rename_to` - short for rename all, renames every member in the server to the desired rename_to condition as long as you have permission.
* `mall message` - short for message all, messages every member in a guild with a message of your choice.
* `dall condition` - short for delete all, deletes every condition stated. Conditions currently include; `channels`, `roles`, `emojis` and `all`.
* `destroy` - deletes everything possible, then bans every member in the server as long as you have permission.

## Setup
Download the files for the bot and make sure Python 3.7 is installed.
After you have done those steps, simply install the following dependencies:

* discord.py REWRITE

You can do this by typing `pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite` into cmd as long as Python is in path.

After this, open the bot file in an IDE or text editor and input your token and desired prefix.

## Anything else?

Not really, that's about it. Just remember, **I AM NOT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY ISSUES THIS CAUSES**. I am just a dev showing how things can be abused. Hope you enjoy!
